| **Definition**     | The work done by a force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement. | Energy is defined as the capacity to do work.      | Power is defined as the rate at which work is done. |
| **Formula**        | Work can be calculated by multiplying Force and Distance in the direction of the force as follows: `W = F × d` | The energy stored in an object due to its position and height is known as potential energy and is given by the formula: `P.E. = mgh` | The formula for power is: `P = W/t`                |
| **Unit**           | The SI unit of work is the Joule (J)                 | The SI unit of energy is Joules (J).                 | The SI unit of power is Watt (W).                  |
